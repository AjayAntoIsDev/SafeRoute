   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   Create a `.env` file with your Groq API key:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   # Using the provided script
   ./run.sh
   
   # Or manually
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## üì± Mobile Development

### Android Setup
```bash
# Build the web app
npm run build

# Add Android platform

```

## üîß Configuration

### API Keys Required

1. **Groq API Key**
   - Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
   - Create account and generate API key
   - Used for AI disaster analysis and chatbot features

2. **Optional Services**
   - Weather API services (configured in backend)
   - Geographic data services

### Environment Variables

**Backend (.env)**
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
PORT=8000
```

**Frontend (.env)**
```env
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## üîç How It Works
